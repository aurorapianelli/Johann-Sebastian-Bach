<h1 style="font-family:Blackadder ITC;">An overview of life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach. </h1>

<p style="font-family:Blackadder ITC;">A story written by Lorenzo Petrucci</p>

<p style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;">Since I was in middle and high school, I have always wondered why we, as students, had necessarily to listen and study Beethoven’s or Mozart’s or Bach’s music and not to listen to other more contemporary singers, for instance. For sure, these three authors are indeed giants in the music field and sooner or later all musicians or singers have to confront these three giants. But the questions still stand: why these three? What do they have that is so special? And, at school, was it just a question of liking or disliking? Was it a question of “we have always done it this way”? Or was it there something more, something more hidden, but ultimately very useful in understanding the success of these three? This article seeks a(n) (possible) answer to these questions, with particular reference to one of the three: Johann Sebastian Bach.As we all know, Bach was an essential figure for 18th century music and in his life he was a composer and could play many instruments. Moreover, he started playing music at a very young age and in a favorable family which already played and listened to music. This probably had an important influence in Bach and in his willingness to compose music.</p>

<p style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;">I have always thought that music is not just a matter of a script and some notes, but it’s sound, beauty, experience and emotions all linked together. We can but imagine what kind of environment Bach experienced first hand in his young age in relation to music in his family. When he first had the possibility to compose music, he completely dived into baroque music and composed 25 notable works, among which I would like to quote the famous “Toccata and fugue in R minor” and then “suite n 3 in re Maggiore BWV 1086”, best known to all of Italians as the soundtrack of Piero Angela’s <i>Superquark</i>.</p>

<p style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;">Additionally, during his career, he was influenced by other European composers, such as Vivaldi, Johann Georg Pisendel and Johann Pachelbel. I think this represents an important influence for Bach because it tells us about the existence of a proto-european taste for a particular kind of music already a long time ago. Of course, this is of determining importance if we think that music is not simply music, but identity and culture.</p>


<p style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;"> So, Bach’s fortune and music is quite visible today: we still listen to Bach’s music or hum some of Bach’s refrains even without knowing it. Moreover, Bach’s music is also present in some films as soundtrack or in TV programs as we saw before with the case of  <i>Superquark</i>.</p>

<p style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;">This table precisely shows the relations between Johann Sebastian Bach and contemporary films and also shows how Bach’s music was taken as an example for one film in 1984 and in two films both in 2003 and in 2004, not so much time ago.
So, going back to our initial question, why listening to Bach today? Of course, one possible answer could be that we like listening to his music; we could also argue that we like classical music and classical composers more than contemporary music and it would be perfectly acceptable. However, there is one thing that we need to consider when we deal with such kind of music and it is more related to who we are, as citizens, as Europeans, and also as Italians, when we listen to Bach’s music: it is therefore more a question of identity than of liking or disliking something. Certainly, we may continue liking or disliking Bach’s music according to our own preferences, but we can’t deny that Bach music – as well as Mozart’s and Beethoven’s – left a permanent mark in our European identity, consequently shaping our tastes and likes. As other cultural products, music is not immune to matters regarding the collective identity of a people or a nation: if we like Michelangelo’s David, it is because we feel it as part of our collective shared past. If we broaden our perspective, we could also argue that statues like Michelangelo’s David are not just part of our national collective identity as Italians, but also for other European people who identify with the beauty for a period of time which redefined art in our continent. And if Michelangelo redefined art, Bach redefined music in the 18th century, that is, the same we have said on Michelangelo is applicable to Bach, and whether we listen to Bach today is not just only because we like him, but because we feel him as part of us as a European people. He and his music have entered our common European cultural heritage and have defined who we are today: after all, all people and nations need some heritage to rely on, to feel stable and anchored to the past. Well, this story has aimed at showing how we are still anchored to Bach’s music and how our identity is still shaped for “some notes” composed more than two centuries ago.</p>
